## Template for login system
 
To use:
- Make sure you have an SQL engine setup. (I use MySQL)
- Run the sql file but make sure to change the database, table, column, and values according to your requirments
- Run the python file to setup the flask server. You can change the app.run parameters to switch to different ports.
- inside the templates folder are the html pages being served. index.html is the default page served, login
is served if login is successful, deny is served when login not successful
